This is a car dealership Java/Spring JSP based application that implements online car sales.  This helps in managing data related to buyers and sellers of the cars. A user can create an account, login and select a vehicle(s) to add to a cart for a purchase. If there are vehicles that have been sitting in inventory for over 90 days then a 10% discount is applied to the purchase price. The sale is managed by Stripe API. Once the buyer selects purchase then the page routs to Stripe for payment. The buyer enters their payment information. Once the payment is successful, a successful payment Stripe will reroute back to the cardealership application and a payment successful message will appear.
